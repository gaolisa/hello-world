# hello-world
First repository, no clue what I'm doing, but this is cool.

I'm editing the file through github right now, but going to try some command line stuff later.

*EDIT: Completed push to master via command line, now going to make some changes in a branch and push that up to github too.*

*EDIT 2: Yay obviously the previous push worked. Now I'm trying github desktop (very intuitive interface), so if you're reading this, then that worked too.*
